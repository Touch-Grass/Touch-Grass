# GitHub Branch Naming Convention

In this repository, we use a concise branch naming convention:

- Use one of the following prefixes: `feature/`, `hotfix/`, `bugfix/`, or `refactor/`, followed by the name of the branch.

For example:
- `feature/user-authentication`
- `hotfix/fix-login-issue`
- `bugfix/404-page-bug`
- `refactor/update-database-schema`

By following this simple convention, we categorize branches by their purpose, making it easy to understand their intent at a glance.
